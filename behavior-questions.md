### What features make customers happy?

**NPS (Net Promoter Score 순수 고객 추천 지수)**
NPS measures customer experience and it can be used as KPI (Ker Performance Indicator 핵심성과지표).

1. Customer satisfaction survey does not relate to the actual performance of **`customer retention rate`**  because respondents tend to give a relatively `good score`
2. According to the Harvard Business Review, NPS is actually proportional to the company's three year growth rate. 
3. NPS is simple and easy to use

* Measures NPS by 11 points (0~10 points) and calculate NPS by subtracting `detractors` from `promoters`
* `How likely isit that you would recommend the product or brand to a friend or colleague` is the question. 
* Theoretically the range of the score can be from -100 to +100. 
* At least 250 customers should respond
